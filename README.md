# Analyzing Students' Mental Health

In this project, I analyze a dataset of students in a Japanese university to understand how the length of stay impacts their average mental health. Mental health is evaluated based on the following metrics: depression, social connectedness (extent to which individuals feel a sense of belonging in a group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with adapting to a new culture).

For the step-by-step analysis, please see the `students_mental_health.ipynb` file.
